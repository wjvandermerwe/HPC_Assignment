### The Code is split into two sub projects due the the runtime requirements for each 
## Thus loading each induvidually is prefered to load the seperate makelistfile 

## Project1: Problem1 this project should run solely with the provided libraries in ./Common directory

## Project2: Problem 2 has a docker file with roughly 1-2gb worth of downloadables that should make it easy to run the file otherwise please ensure all dependancies are installed as used in the MakeFileLists.txt spesification

## Each Project has readme instructions in the sub directory.

## all experiments were conducted on a personal gpu enabled workstation station.
